Hello guys! My name is Nam. I am a third-year student at the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology. I blog to save knowledge about what I've learned regarding computer science. This is a record of my knowledge so there may still be many inaccuracies. If you see any inaccuracies, please leave a comment below or email me directly at lvnam0801@gmail. Thank you for your attention.
