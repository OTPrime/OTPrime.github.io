Hello guys! My name is Nam. I am a third-year student at the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology. I write the blog to save the knowledge of what I have learned related to computer science. This is the knowledge recorded in my understanding so there are definitely many mistakes. If you see any errors, please leave a comment below or send an email directly to me at lvnam0801@gmail.com. Thank you for your attention
