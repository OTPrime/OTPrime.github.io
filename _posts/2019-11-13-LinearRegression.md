### Definition

As mentioned in the previous section, regression analysis is a statistical analysis to determine the relationship between dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Linear regression is the most common form of regression analysis.

Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The relationships are modeled using linear predictor function whose unknown model parameters are estimated(learned) from the data. Such models are called linear models. It attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

A linear regression line has an equation of the form <strong>Y = a + bX</strong>, where <strong>X</strong> is the explanatory variable(independent variable) and <strong>Y</strong> is the dependent variable. The slope of the line is <strong>b</strong>, and <strong>a</strong> is the intercept(the value of <strong>y</strong> when <strong>x</strong> = 0 also called bias)
