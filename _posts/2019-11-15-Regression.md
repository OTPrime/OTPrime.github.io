title: Regression analysis

> According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) In statistical modeling, <strong><em>regression analysis </em></strong> is a set of statisticcal processes for estimating the relationship between a dependent variable(often called the 'outcome variable' or 'Y-variabel) and one or more independant variable('offen called 'predictor', 'covariates' or 'features'). The most common form of regression analysis is [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) which will be examined in more detail in the following sections. 

> Regression analysis is a statistical analysis to determine how independent variable (feature) define dependent variabel(label).  
    
Regression analysis is technique used to derive equations that best fit with observed result set(the training data) of dependant(Y) and independant variables(X). It allow to obtain the best estimate of the relationship between variables. From this estimation equation, we can predict the dependant variable(unknown variable) based on the value of the independant variable(known variable).

### Example

The simplest example of regression analysis is a linear equation with one independant and dependant variable. For example: 
- Given a data set on people's income and consumption. The problem is to find the equation that best fits the given data set. Specifically, the given data set includes two variables: income(independent variable) and consumption(dependent variable). The gold is to find an equation that show the relationship between income variable and consumption variable, so that when a person's income is available, we can predict their consumption value.
